Quick Start
===========

.Command is built to be incredibly easy to use, in here, you're going to find two sections, one will get you running
with no work, and the other is a bit more manual, but provides you more control.

Quickest Start
--------------
Simply drag the prefab DebugConsoleLoader from the /WellFired/WellFired.Command.Prefabs directory into your scene and
press play. You can now toggle .Command with the tilde (~) key, or by pressing the bottom at the top left of the screen.
Once open .Command should look something like this.
