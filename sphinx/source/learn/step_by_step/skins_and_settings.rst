.Command ships with a couple of options that can be modified to suit your needs. These options reside in the Unity
Preference window. To access them, go to Unity > Preferences (on macOS) or Edit > Preferencesâ€¦ (Windows).

From here, select the .Command menu in the left hand pane.

There are currently only two global .Command settings.

    .Command will by default send anonymous analytics data to WellFired Development to help improve .Command
    functionality, if you don't want this feature, be sure to disable this option.
